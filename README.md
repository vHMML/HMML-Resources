Note: Many of the items in this folder are “zipped.” The user will have to “unzip” the files to extract the contents. Windows generally does this automatically when the file is double-clicked.

■ Canon DPP 4.18.0-installer.zip
Digital Photo Professional (DPP) from Canon is their all-purpose RAW converter, image viewer and basic image manipulation application. It also works in conjunction with EOS Utility to work as the tethered photography system for Canon digital cameras. As of 2023-11-01, this is the latest 64-bit version—use this version if you are using the new Canon EOS RP mirrorless camera.

■ EU-Installset-W3.16.10.8.zip
Canon’s EOS Utility (EU) works as the remote control for a digital camera tethered to the computer via USB cable. Camera functions are controlled by this software utility, bypassing the need to manipulate controls on the camera itself. When used with Digital Photo Professional and properly set up, images shot with the camera are transferred to the computer and appear in the DPP viewer.

Note: HMML has older versions of both of these Canon software applications. Folks using older computer systems or earlier camera models may have a need for these. Contact HMML if you need a “legacy” version of DPP or EU.
